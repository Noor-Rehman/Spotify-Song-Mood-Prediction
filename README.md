# Spotify-Song-Mood-Prediction-Clustering-
This project uses Spotify's Web API to predict song moods and perform clustering based on features like danceability, energy, and loudness. By applying K-means and SVC, we uncover mood patterns and offer insights for personalized music recommendations and music therapy, aligning with SDG 3.
